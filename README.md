# A C# & C++ Game Engine  

This project contains:  
- C++ render engine (CPP-Vulkan)
- C# game engine, with bindings to the render engine! (VEngine)

## CPP-Vulkan
This is a C++ render engine, using Vulkan 1.3.  
It has an api.h file, which is the only file you need to include to use the engine.  
It abstracts the Vulkan API, and makes it easier to use.  

## VEngine
This is a C# game engine, with bindings to the render engine.  
It uses cross-platform libraries, and is designed to be easy to use.
